# Final-Year-Thesis-Continuum-Model-for-Bilayer-Graphene

This thesis focuses on the interaction between two layers of graphene. The energy levels between the layers vary based on the relative rotation angle between the two layers.
The pattern it creates is called the Moire pattern, and at certain angle configurations, the electrical resistance between the layers can drop to zero. 
This means superconductivity is achieved. Note that this is still only possible at ultra-low temperatures. Near absolute Kelvin. However, this system should be 
studied further as it may contain the secrets to higher temperature superconductivity.
